This project investigates how accurately machine learning models can predict the severity of road traffic accidents in Great Britain using environmental, road, vehicle, driver, spatial and temporal features from the UK Department for Transport’s STATS19 open dataset.

It combines data engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning, explainability (SHAP), spatial hotspot detection, and time-series forecasting into a single, reproducible analytics pipeline.
